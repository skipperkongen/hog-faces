#   This face detector is made using the now classic Histogram of Oriented
#   Gradients (HOG) feature combined with a linear classifier, an image
#   pyramid, and sliding window detection scheme.  This type of object detector
#   is fairly general and capable of detecting many types of semi-rigid objects
#   in addition to human faces.  Therefore, if you are interested in making
#   your own object detectors then read the train_object_detector.py example
#   program.

# Finally, if you really want to you can ask the detector to tell you the score
# for each detection.  The score is bigger for more confident detections.
# The third argument to run is an optional adjustment to the detection threshold,
# where a negative value will return more detections and a positive value fewer.
# Also, the idx tells you which of the face sub-detectors matched.  This can be
# used to broadly identify faces in different orientations.
